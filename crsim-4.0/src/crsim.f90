  !!  *LAST CHANGES* 
  !! 
  !!  Sep 15- Sep 23  2015   - A.T.   changes introduced in order to compute the radial Doppler velocity and spectrum width
  !!  Oct 20 2015            - A.T.   corrected issue with dlog10(0.d0) appearing
  !!  Jan 05 2016            - A.T.   bug when computing the Zdr_tot and LDRh_tot is now corrected.Unrealistic Zdr_tot and
  !!                                  LDRh_tot were due to incorrectly placed line for changing of units from linear to logaritmic
  !!                                  for rmout%Zhh_tot
  !!  Jan 11 2016            - A.T.   control variable hmask is removed as it is now obsolate  
  !!  Jan 11 2016            - A.T.   included threshold value Zthr (= -100 dBZ)  of minimum reflectivity such that:
  !!                                     1. if Zhh>Zthr => Zhh,Ah and all Doopler-related variables exist
  !!                                     2. if Zvv>Zthr => Zvv, Av exist
  !!                                     3. if both Zhh,Zvv > Zthr => all other polarimetric variables exist (Zvh,Zdr,LDR,Kdp,Zdr)
  !! Jan 12 2016             - A.T.   included new parameters in Configuration file, the minimum values of the input mixing ratios
  !!                                  for species. Mixing ratio values smaller or equal than specified thresholds are set to 0. In the
  !!                                  case of MP_PHYSICS=20, in the pixels where computed mixing ratio is <= specified threshold,
  !!                                  the input bin total number distributions are set to zeros.
  !! Jan 13 2016             - A.T.   Zvh was not reported in logaritmic but linear units. It is now corrected and all the  reflecivity 
  !!                                  related variables are reported in logaritmic units.                                   
  !! Jan 14-JAn 15  2016     - A.T.   Included computation of spectrum width contributions due to turnulence, wind shear in radar
  !!                                  volume and cross-wind.
  !! Feb 17 2016             - A.T.   Icluded computation od cloud lidar (ceilometer) measurements
  !! Feb 18 2016             - A.T.   Corrected bug in sign when computing Doppler velocity at elevations different than 90 deg. All 
  !!                                  velocties are now positive away from the radar (radar notation).
  !!
  !! March 26 2016           -A.T.    Subroutine get_hydro_vars is modified to work for MP_PHYSICS=9. For this  reason get_hydro_vars is
  !!                                  splitted out to 2 subroutines: get_hydro10_vars and get_hydro09_vars. In the case of Morrisson scheme,
  !!                                  a possibility of the input cloud liquid total concentration /=0 is taken into account. 
  !! May 2  2016             -A.T.    Included computation od micropulse lidar (MPL) measurements for cloud and ice hydrometeors

  !!  *DESCRIPTION* 
  !!
  !!  The CR-SIM uses the inputs from the high resolution Weather Research and
  !!  Forecasting Model (WRF), for microphysical schemes MP_PHYSICS=8 (Thompson
  !!  scheme), MP_PHYSICS=10 (Morrison double-moment scheme), MP_PHYSICS=9 (Milbrandt
  !!  and Yau double-moment scheme), MP_PHYSICS=20 (bin explicit scheme), and
  !!  MP_PHYSICS=50 (Predicted particle properties scheme) and computes “idealized”
  !!  forward modeled scanning (or vertical-pointing) radar observations (Figure 1)
  !!  and profiling lidar observables. The latest version can use the inputs from the
  !!  ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic general circulation model (ICON, MP_PHYSICS=30) and
  !!  the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS, MP_PHYSICS=40), and System for
  !!  Atmospheric Modeling (SAM, MP_PHYSICS=70 for bin microphysics, MP_PHYSICS=75 for
  !!  Morrison double-moment scheme).
  !!  
  !!  The CR-SIM employs the T-matrix method for computation of scattering
  !!  characteristics such as cloud water, cloud ice, rain, snow, graupel, hail and 
  !!  allows the specifications of the following radar frequencies for scattering
  !!  calculations: 3 GHz, 5.5 GHz, 9.5 GHz, 35 GHz and 94 GHz. 
  !!
  !!  Given the particles size distributions (explicit or reconstructed from the
  !!  provided PSD moments), polarimetric radar variables can be calculated if the
  !!  scattering amplitudes are known. The complex scattering amplitudes are
  !!  pre-computed and stored as look-up tables (LUTs) for equally spaced particle
  !!  sizes using the Mishchenko's T-matrix code for a non-spherical particle at a
  !!  fixed orientation (Mishchenko, 2000) and for elevation angles from 0° to 90°
  !!  with a spacing of 1°, for specified radar frequencies, temperatures and
  !!  different possibilities of particles densities and aspect ratios. 
  !!
  !!  It is worth noting that some particle characteristics needed to simulate
  !!  polarimetric variables such as the shape or the statistical properties of the
  !!  particle orientations are not explicitly specified in the model. Thus certain
  !!  assumptions have to be made, based on much available information as possible.
  !!  For example, the mean canting angles of all hydrometeors are assumed to be 0°.
  !!  This assumption enables the use of Ryzkov et al. (2010) formulations for
  !!  computation of polarimetric variables and especially the use of simple
  !!  expressions for the angular moments, which in turn make possible that the width
  !!  of 2D Gaussian distribution of canting angle that is different for various
  !!  hydrometeor species can be specified. 
  !!
  !!
  !!  *INPUT*
  !!
  !!  The I/O files are specified in th ecommand line while the 
  !!  configuration parameters are specified in the file "PARAMETERS"
  !!  For additional information, please see CR-SIM User Guide.
  !!
  !!  *OUTPUT* 
  !!
  !!  A set of netcdf output files is generated. The main output file is the one
  !!  that refers to the CR-SIM output for the total hydrometeor content.
  !!  The additional output files will be created for each hydrometeor class. 
  !!  Per default, they will have extensions “_cloud”, ”_rain”, ”_ice”, “_snow”,
  !!  “_graupel”, “_hail”, "drizzle", "aggregare", "smallice", "unrimed_ice", 
  !!  and parimedice" before the “.nc”.
  !!  The polarimetric variables simulated include reflectivity at vertical and
  !!  horizontal polarization, differential reflectivity, specific differential phase,
  !!  specific attenuation at horizontal and vertical polarization, specific
  !!  differential attenuation, and linear depolarization ratio. Also simulated are
  !!  the vertical reflectivity weighted velocity, mean Doppler velocity and spectrum
  !!  width. The computation of fall velocities is consistent to the computational
  !!  method used in the specific WRF microphysical package.
